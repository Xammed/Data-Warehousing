For Ganesh my man

OS: Depends on the machine. This is mac but it is my work laptop, my main machine dual boots windows and ubuntu.

Github Experience: Very familiar, have used for years for work/personal projects/school. I still forget the basics sometimes...

Tool: CLI

Tutorial: Nothing this time, but if I forget typically I just google the first sub five minute video or make an empty repo with the init directions.
